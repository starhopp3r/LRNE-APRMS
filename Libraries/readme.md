# TFT screen documentation (240*320)
I downloaded the library from the website I bought the TFT touch screen module from.

It is written in chinese, to download the library it is required to have a baidu account

Follow the readme under Arduino UNO examples. These 4 libraries are required:
- Adafruit_GFX
- Adafruit_TFTLCD
- TouchScreen
