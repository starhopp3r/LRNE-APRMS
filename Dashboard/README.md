# ðŸ§­ Compass Dashboard

The ðŸ§­ Compass Dashboard is designed to be a simple, lean and mean piece of software that acts as a mission control for HADR teams to use.

When someone mentions mission control, massive projectors and data screens spring to mind. A mission control is a place where data needs to be localised and at the same time highly relevant and useful to the operator. This dashboard was made with this philosophy in mind.
